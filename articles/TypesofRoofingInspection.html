<p class='ArticleText' ><b>There are many types of roofing inspection, we divide them into the following broad categories:</b></p>
<ul class='ArticleText'>
<li class='ArticleText'><b class='ArticleText'>General Condition Inspection</b> - understand and record the general condition of your roof</li>

<li class='ArticleText'><b class='ArticleText'>Problem Diagnosis</b> - investigate a specific issue</li>

<li class='ArticleText'><b class='ArticleText'>Quality Assurance</b> - check the quality and effectiveness of work</li>

</ul></div>
<div class='ArticleText'><p class='ArticleText'><b class="ArticleText">General Condition Inspection</b></p>
<p class='ArticleText'>This is the most common and most comprehensive type of inspection, giving a complete view of the roof and its main features.  This is often used as part of a formal property survey.</p>
<p class='ArticleText'>Regular condition inspections give a view of how a roof is wearing and help in planning preventitive maintenance, to avoid longer term damage and the associated costs.</p></div>
<div class='ArticleText'><p class='ArticleText'><b class='ArticleText'>Problem Diagnosis</b></p>
<p class='ArticleText'>You may already know that there is a problem, but an aerial inspection can help you to accurately diagnose both the cause and location of the root problem.</p>
<p class='ArticleText'>This can save time and money by avoiding building scaffolding towers unnecessarily or in the wrong place.</p></div>
<div class='ArticleText'><p class='ArticleText'><b class='ArticleText'>Quality Assurance</b></p>
<p class='ArticleText'>When work has been done it can be important to check that the work meets expectations in terms of both quality and effectiveness.</p>
<p class='ArticleText'>In short this can tell you whether or not a problem has really gone away.</p></div>
